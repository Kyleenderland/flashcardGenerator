# HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM:

This is a program that reads in a text file and uses the lines of text to generate a series of flashcards.
The first line the program reads in will be the question of the first flashcard. The next line will be the answer.
This repeats for every two lines of text until the file ends, generating new flashcards. When the cards display, their
order is randomized.

On execution, the program will open up a file picker. Simply open a text document that has all of your questions and answers
saved. After that, simply click the button when you'd like to move on to the next flashcard.
